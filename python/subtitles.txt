andhappenings and flexus paintings whenthey did happen were coming off of thewall and invading your space and therewas also this thing that Kossuth wasdoing which came to be called conceptualart in 1967 artist Sol LeWitt explainedit like this in conceptual art the ideaour concept is the most important aspectof the work it means that all theplanning and decisions are madebeforehand and the execution is aperfunctory affair the idea becomes themachine that makes the art for looatthis often meant creating specificinstructions and diagrams forlarge-scale wall drawings that could becarried

interestingI do not wish to add any moreI prefer simply to state the existenceof things in terms of time and/or placewhich brings us back to those chairsbecause what Kossuth is doing ispointing out the existence of things intime and place taking it a few stepsfurther than when Magritte reminded usthat this painting of a pipe is not apipe like when we look at this paintingof a chair we know it&amp;#39;s not a real chairbut we&amp;#39;re probably not thinking abouthow it&amp;#39;s a kind of sign we recognize asindicating a chair just as a dictionarydefinition is a verbal sign that

[MUSIC PLAYING]NARRATOR: You&amp;#39;re in a museum.In one room, you
admire an exquisitelyrendered painting
of a lush gardenby Spanish artist
Santiago Rusinol.In another you encounter one
of the most famous paintingsin the world, a monumental work
by Picasso that bowls you overwith its dynamic
composition of abstractedbut still recognizable
figures and forms,telling you of the
horrors of the 1937bombing of the
village of Guernicaduring the Spanish Civil War.And in another room you come
across something completelydifferent-- a picture of a
chair, a chair, and a blown updictionary definition of a chair
by Toledo, Ohio born artistJoseph Kosuth.What the actual [NO AUDIO].Can we really call this art?This thing that is entirely
unlike those other thingsin the rooms before it?That exhibits no technical skill
and transports due to nowherebut right where you are,
in an empty feeling,slightly chilly gallery?How can this be art and what
am I supposed to do with it?This is the case
for conceptual art.Kosuth made this work
in New York in 1965.In the years leading up, the
Equal Pay Act had been passed,President John F Kennedy
was assassinated,the Civil Rights Act was
freshly signed into law,and the Vietnam War and protests
against it were in full effect.The decade&amp;#39;s identity as one
of counter-cultural revolutionwas crystallizing.And the art of the
time likewise reflecteda widespread questioning
of tradition.There was pop art and minimalism
and happenings and fluxus.Paintings, when they did happen,
were coming off of the walland invading your space.And there was also
this thing that Kosuthwas doing which came to
be called conceptual art.In 1967, artist Sol Lewitt
explained it like this--&amp;quot;In conceptual art
the idea or conceptis the most important
aspect of the work.It means that all the
planning and decisionsare made beforehand
and the executionis a perfunctory affair.The idea becomes the
machine that makes the art.&amp;quot;For Lewitt, this often meant
creating specific instructionsand diagrams for large
scale wall drawings thatcould be carried out by others.Even after Lewitt&amp;#39;s death, a
drafts person or many of themcan make the drawing
happen as longas the instructions and
certificate of authenticityare on hand.The resulting works
can be magnificentbut it&amp;#39;s not the individual
touch of the artist thatmakes them so.It&amp;#39;s the idea supported
by proper execution.Sometimes people were the
machines that made the art.Like for a 1969
piece, Vito Acconcichallenged himself to follow
randomly selected passersby until they entered
a private space.He said of it, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m
almost not an &amp;#39;I&amp;#39; anymore;I put myself in the
service of this scheme.&amp;quot;And sometimes it was
actually machinesthat were the machines
that made the art.Ian Burn&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Xerox Book&amp;quot; came
to be when he photocopieda blank sheet of white paper
and then copied that copyand so on and so forth 100 times
with more and more visual noiseappearing as he went.Documentation is
often how we cometo know about conceptual art.And that&amp;#39;s OK because
the physical presenceis secondary to the idea
that brought it into being.You didn&amp;#39;t have to be there
to see Eleanor Antin parade 50pairs of rubber boots on a trip
around California and New York.She took photos and
made postcards of themand mailed them to hundreds
of artists and museumsand libraries and friends.And when you see one
of those postcardsor hear about them
in a YouTube video,your understanding isn&amp;#39;t
really distorted or diminished.Art critic and
curator Lucy Lipparddescribed what was
happening at the timeas a dematerialization.It wasn&amp;#39;t often as literal as
John Baldessari&amp;#39;s cremationpiece of 1969.In which he burned
all of his paintingsand had the ashes interred in
a wall of the Jewish Museum.Because materials were
almost always involved,it&amp;#39;s just that they
were often ephemeral--maps, diagrams, photos,
books or at least notthe primary concern.Even molten lead became
fleeting, as much as it can be,in the hands of Richard
Serra who in the late &amp;#39;60sfocused on action and
process over finished object.None of his original splash
or cast pieces still exist.They were made for temporary
shows and discarded after.Uniqueness wasn&amp;#39;t important.He has since made new iterations
following the same procedure.More characteristic
of conceptual artis Douglas Huebler&amp;#39;s
&amp;quot;Duration Piece #6&amp;quot;for which he made a rectangle
of sawdust in a doorwayand documented it every
half hour for six hours.The sawdust was then cleared
away and what you see hereis the final piece.Huebler said at the time,
&amp;quot;The world is full of objects,more or less interesting; I
do not wish to add any more.I prefer simply to state
the existence of thingsin terms of time and/or place.&amp;quot;Which brings us
back to those chairsbecause what Kosuth is
doing is pointing outthe existence of things
in time and place.Taking it a few steps further
than when Magritte reminded usthat this painting of
a pipe is not a pipe.Like when we look at
this painting of a chair,we know it&amp;#39;s not a real chair.But we&amp;#39;re probably not thinking
about how it&amp;#39;s a kind of signwe recognize as
indicating a chair.Just as a dictionary definition
is a verbal sign thatpoints to something in
the world and a photographis a visual sign that
points to something thatis or used to be in the world.Which of these
three chairs do weperceive to be more
chair than the other,especially now that this real
one is in a museum collectionand will likely never
be sat in again?If this putting regular stuff
in a museum sounds familiar,it&amp;#39;s because Duchamp, who made
conceptual art way before itwas cool or even had a name.In 1913, Marcel Duchamp
attached a bicycle wheelto a wooden stool and called
it a ready made work of art.It was art because
he said it wasand because he put
it in a gallery.Kosuth&amp;#39;s operation
here is similar.He said, &amp;quot;The art consists of my
action of placing this activityin an art context.&amp;quot;But the art context didn&amp;#39;t
have to be a gallery.Sure, there were
exhibitions thatchronicled this kind of
art but more often the artwas its own means
of distribution.Seth Siegelaub thought
of his &amp;quot;Xerox Book&amp;quot;as an exhibition
venue in itself,giving each artist
included 25 pagesto make a work that responded
in some way to the format.On Kawara made art by
documenting his everyday lifeand mailing news
of it on postcardsto friends, acquaintances,
and art collectors.Eleanor Antin photographed
herself naked every morningto document her weight loss of
10 pounds over the course of 37days.And Mary Kelly
recorded the activityof taking care of her young
son, reflected on motherhoodand conversations with him.And eventually allowed
him to scribble overher documentation.As Lippard wrote
in 1973, &amp;quot;Much artnow is transported
by the artist,or in the artist himself.&amp;quot;Conceptual art was a
way of working aroundthe power structures of the
art world, which as it happens,was rife with himself&amp;#39;s
and around market concerns.Lee Lozano began her general
strike peace in 1969,declaring her withdrawal
from the art worldand documenting her final
visits to gallery openingsand museums.Conceptual art was
out in the world,often blending with activism.The Art Workers Coalition
organized in 1969to agitate for artists rights
and against Vietnam, racism,and sexism.But for the most
part, conceptual artwas political not in its
illustration of current eventsbut in its commitment to
rethink the status quo.There was a worker
mentality and pragmatismto much first generation
conceptual art.A deadpan recording and
structuring of life,almost aggressively
unartful, thatreplaced the careful
consideration of compositionand form and flourish
normally associatedwith art and artists.Ed Ruscha&amp;#39;s book &amp;quot;Twenty-six
Gasoline Stations&amp;quot;recorded exactly that,
26 gasoline stations.Bernd and Hilla Becher took
straightforward picturesof water towers.That&amp;#39;s what they did,
across years and continents.There was no trickery at play,
no need for an interpreter.What&amp;#39;s needed for this kind of
art, more than interpretation,is a shift in perspective.An opening of a door that allows
an idea by Douglas Hueblerto be art.A piece of paper that
reads, the line aboveis rotating on its
axis at a speedof one revolution each day.Or a sign to be art, like
this one by Luis Camnitzer.You can sit with this
for a few seconds.In 1969, artist and
writer Victor Burgincontended &amp;quot;It may now be said
that an object becomes or failsto become a work of
art in direct responseto the inclination
of the perceiverto assume an appreciative role.As Morse Peckham has put
it, &amp;#39;Art is not a categoryof perceptual fields
but of role playing.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;So it&amp;#39;s up to you.Do you want to play a
role and call this art?If you do, congratulations.In some cases, you
might now own it.Laurence Weiner&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Two Minutes
Of Spray Paint DirectlyUpon The Floor From A
Standard Aerosol Spray Can&amp;quot;is exactly what it sounds like.And according to the artist
the year after it was made,&amp;quot;They don&amp;#39;t have to
buy it to have it.They can have it
just by knowing it.&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re used to art
galleries beingplaces where visual
experience reigns supreme.But conceptual art asks us
to understand the galleryexperience as never having
been purely visual--always informed by our other
senses, the arts context,and the invisible perceptual
operations happeningin our minds to process it.Conceptual art has
given us new wordsto describe what we encounter
and new levels of interaction.We can still appreciate
a masterful painting,but in a world after conceptual
art we do so with our blindersoff.Understanding that art
is composed of signs.It illustrates, it lives
in specific buildings,it decorates rich
people&amp;#39;s homes.Once conceptualized lessons
have been internalizedwe see that this
is not a garden.This is not what
happened at Guernica.Conceptual art still
lives and blendswith many other ways of making.But it&amp;#39;s a slippery
art, one thatavoids living in just one spot,
one that resists ownershipand being turned into
other luxury good.Despite its utopian
aims, conceptual artwas and is still gobbled
up by institutionsand put on the auction block.But when it&amp;#39;s good,
it lives far outsideof our art stores and
places of art worship.And in this way,
these ephemeral worksare strangely more permanent
for there never havingmuch physicality to begin with.Marble crumbles, paintings
fade, but ideas--ideas can last forever. Hey, guys.PBS Digital Studios is
